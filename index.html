       <p>In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.[1][2][3] The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

       <p>
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

       <p>
A Queue Data Structure is a fundamental concept in computer science used for storing and managing data in a specific order. It follows the principle of “First in, First out” (FIFO), where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are commonly used in various algorithms and applications for their simplicity and efficiency in managing data flow.</p>

       <p>
A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science. It consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.</p>

       <p>
A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. </p>

       <p>
A Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It’s used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles. </p>

Welcome to Data Structure and Alogorithms Visualizer(DSAV), where the world of data structures and algorithms comes to life! Our platform is dedicated to providing interactive visualizations and educational resources to aid in understanding these fundamental concepts in computer science. <br />
<br />
Here, our passion for technology and learning inspired us to create a space where students, professionals, and educators alike can explore and master data structures and algorithms in an engaging and intuitive way.<br />

Driven by the belief that knowledge should be accessible to all, we've carefully curated a collection of visualizations to cater to learners at every level. If you're just starting your journey into the world of programming or seeking to deepen your understanding, we're here to support your first steps.<br />
<br />
As the creators of DSAV, we bring of our practical knowledge in the field of computer engineering while we ourselves are learning as students and a deep commitment to empowering others through education. We are incredibly grateful to our guide Prof. Vidya Bhosale and who has supported and guided us to the development of this platform.<br />
<br />
We currently have the visualizations for arrays, stacks and queues.Looking ahead, we're excited to continue expanding DSAV with new content that include linked lists, trees and graphs,and resources to better serve our growing community.   <br />

Thank you for joining us on this journey of discovery and learning.<br />
<br />
Explore, learn, and enjoy!<br />
